 During the British colonial era from 1700 to 1912 Kolkata was the capital of British India. 
 Kolkata witnessed a spate of frenzied construction activity in the early 1850s by several 
  British companies. The construction was largely influenced by the conscious intermingling 
  of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, and Oriental designs. Unlike many north Indian cities
 , whose construction stresses minimalism, much of the layout of the architectural variety in
   Kolkata owes its origins from European styles and tastes imported mainly by the British,
 and lesser extent of the Portuguese and French.Today, many of these structures are in various
 stages of decay. Some of the major buildings of this period are well maintained and several buildings have
 been declared as heritage structures. Conservation efforts are patchy and are often affected by problems of 
 litigation, tenant troubles, ownership disputes, old tenancy laws and a lack of funds. <br>
 <b>The Great Eastern Hotel</b> (officially Lalit Great Eastern Hotel) was founded as the Auckland Hotel in 1841, at the 
 crossroads of the Old Courthouse Street and British India Street, founded by confectioner David Wilson and named
 after the then Governor General Lord Auckland. It grew from strength to strength over the 19th and first half of
 the 20th century. Locally known as "Wilson's Hotel", it was also known as "Auckland Hotel and the "Hall of Nations"
 in the 19th century, and was referred to as the "Japani Hotel" (Japanese Hotel) colloquially in the 20th century, 
 due to a large number of Japanese tourists there. The hotel was extremely elite, referred to as the "Jewel of the
 East" and "the best hotel East of the Suez" by Mark Twain on his voyage along the Equator, and described by Rudyard
 Kipling in "The City of Dreadful Night". <br>
 <b>Victoria Memorial</b> was built in the heart of the City of Joy, Kolkata to commemorate the Empress of India and Queen
 of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria after her death in 1901. The Victoria Memorial was modelled on the Taj Mahal 
 and was commissioned in 1906 by Lord Curzon's brainchild. Opened to the public in 1921, it was designed by the 
 architects William Emerson and his protege Vincent Esch at the extraordinary cost of Rupees 10.5 million ($262,500), 
 all of which was collected as voluntary donations, mostly from the British and Indian nobility.<br>
